##Chpater 1: roadmap##
####1.1 what is the Internet?####

---
What's the Internet: "nuts and bolts" view

	- Switches are used in access networks and routers are used in core networks 
	- End systems access the internet through ISPs such as the local cable or telephone companies, university ISPs,..
	- An ISP is a network of packets switches and communication links.
	- ISPs provide a variety of types of network access like wireless, DSL, dial up, high speed LAN. They also provide access to content developers
	- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
	- IP: Internet Protocol (defines the formats of the packets)

- millions of connected computing devices:
	- hosts = end systems
	- running network apps
- communication links
	- fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	- transmission rate: bandwidth
- packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
	- routers and switches
- Internet: “network of networks”
	- Interconnected ISPs
- protocols control sending, receiving of msgs
	- e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype,  802.11
- Internet  standards
	- RFC: Request for comments
	- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

--
"Fun" internet appliances

	Computer networks is a little outdated given that now some non traditional devices are being hooked up to the internet

- IP picture frame
- Web-enabled toaster + weather forecaster
- Tweet-a-watt: monitor energy use
- Internet refrigerator
- Slingbox: watch, control cable TV remotely
- Internet phones

--
What's the Internet: a service view

	- Application Programming Interface (API): set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the internet can deliver its data to the destination program
	- Like the postal service API is put data which is letter in an envelop, seal, stamp, write address and drop at mailbox 

- Infrastructure that provides services to applications:
	- Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, social nets, …
- provides programming interface to apps
	- hooks that allow sending and receiving  app programs to “connect” to Internet
	- provides service options, analogous to postal service

What's a protocol?

- human protocols:
	- "what's the time?"
	- "i have a question"
	- introductions

- network protocols:
	- machines rather than humans
	- all communication activity in Internet governed by protocols

... specific msgs sent
... specific actions taken when msgs received, or other events

- protocols define format, order of msgs sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt
- a human protocol and a computer network protocol:

####1.2 network edge (end systems, access networks, links)####

--
A closer look at network structure

- network edge:
	- hosts: clients and servers
	- servers often in data centres
- access networks, physical media
	- wired, wireless communication links
- network core
	- interconnected routers
	- network of networks

--
Access networks and physical media

	In home the 2 most popular broadband residential access is DSL (digital subscriber line) and cable

*Q: How to connect end systems to edge router?*

	- residential access nets
	- institutional access networks (school, company)
	- mobile access networks

- keep in mind:
	- bandwidth (bits per second) of access network?
	- shared or dedicated?

--
Access net: digital subscriber line (DSL)

	- Typically DSL is obtained from the same local telephone company. It uses twisted pair coper wire
	- DSLAM: Digital subscriber line access multiplexer
	- DSL provider might limit max rate due to tiered services, distance might limit, electrical interference,..
	- DSL is used for short distances if the residential access is not within 10miles from the CO alternative methods must be seeked

- use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM
	- data over DSL phone line goes to Internet
	- voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net
- < 2.5 Mbps upstream transmission rate (typically < 1 Mbps)
- < 24 Mbps downstream transmission rate (typically < 10 Mbps)

--
Access net: cable network

	- Cable modem termination system (CMTS): turns analog signal to digital
	- One junction serves 500 to 5000 homes
	- Cable makes use of the existing television’s company cable.

frequency division multiplexing: different channels transmitted
in different frequency bands

- HFC: hybrid fiber coax
	- asymmetric: up to 42.8Mbps downstream transmission rate, 30.7 Mbps upstream transmission rate
- network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router
	- homes share access network to cable headend 
	- unlike DSL, which has dedicated access to central office

--
Access net: home network

--
Access net: fiber to the home

	ONT: Optical network terminator
	OLT: Optical Line terminator
	Splitter combines up to 100 homes

- Optical Distribution Network Architecture
	- Active (AON)
	- Passive (PON)
- Rates can be up to gigabit per second

--
Enterprise access networks (Ethernet)

- typically used in companies, universities, etc
- 10 Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps transmission rates
- today, end systems typically connect into Ethernet switch

--
Wireless access networks

- shared wireless access network connects end system to router
	- via base station aka “access point”
- wireless LANs:
	- within building (100 ft)
	- 802.11b/g/n/ac (WiFi): up to 300Mbps transmission rate
- wide-area wireless access
	- provided by telco (cellular) operator, 10’s km
	- between 1 and 40 Mbps 
	- 3G, 4G:  LTE

--
Host: sends packets of data

host sending function:

- takes application message
- breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length L bits
- transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R
	- link transmission rate, aka link capacity, aka link bandwidth

--
Physical media

	Bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium

- bit: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- physical link: what lies between transmitter & receiver
- guided media: 
	- signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
- unguided media: 
	- signals propagate freely, e.g., radio, satellite
- twisted pair (TP)
	- two insulated copper wires
		- Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gpbs Ethernet
		- Category 6: 10Gbps

--
Physical media: coax, fiber

- coaxial cable:
	- two concentric copper conductors
	- bidirectional
	- broadband:
 		- multiple channels on cable
- fiber optic cable:
	- glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
	- Used mostly in overseas links
	- high-speed operation:
		- high-speed point-to-point transmission (e.g., 10’s-100’s Gpbs transmission rate)
	- low error rate: 
		- repeaters spaced far apart 
		- immune to electromagnetic noise

--
Physical media: radio

- signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
- no physical “wire”
- bidirectional
- propagation environment effects:
	- reflection 
	- obstruction by objects
	- interference

radio link types:

- terrestrial  microwave
	- e.g. up to 45 Mbps channels
- LAN (e.g., WiFi)
	- 11Mbps, 300 Mbps
- wide-area (e.g., cellular)
	- 3G cellular: ~ few Mbps
- satellite
	- Kbps to hundreds Mbps channel (or multiple smaller channels)
	- 270 msec end-end delay
	- geosynchronous versus low altitude


####1.3 network core (packet switching, circuit switching, network structure)####

--
The network core

- mesh of interconnected routers
- packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into packets
	- forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination
	- each packet transmitted at full link capacity

--
Packet-switching: store-and-forward

- takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bps
- store and forward: entire packet must  arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
- end-end delay = 2L/R (assuming zero propagation delay) -> more on delay shortly ...
- one-hop numerical example:
	- L = 7.5 Mbits
	- R = 1.5 Mbps
	- one-hop transmission delay = 5 sec

--
Packet Switching: queueing delay, loss

queuing and loss: 

- If arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time:
	- packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link 
	- packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up

--
Two key network-core functions

- routing: determines source-destination route taken by packets
	- routing algorithms
- forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output
