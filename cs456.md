##Chpater 1: roadmap##
####1.1 what is the Internet?####

---
What's the Internet: "nuts and bolts" view

	- Switches are used in access networks and routers are used in core networks 
	- End systems access the internet through ISPs such as the local cable or telephone companies, university ISPs,..
	- An ISP is a network of packets switches and communication links.
	- ISPs provide a variety of types of network access like wireless, DSL, dial up, high speed LAN. They also provide access to content developers
	- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
	- IP: Internet Protocol (defines the formats of the packets)

- millions of connected computing devices:
	- hosts = end systems
	- running network apps
- communication links
	- fiber, copper, radio, satellite
	- transmission rate: bandwidth
- packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
	- routers and switches
- Internet: “network of networks”
	- Interconnected ISPs
- protocols control sending, receiving of msgs
	- e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype,  802.11
- Internet  standards
	- RFC: Request for comments
	- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

--
"Fun" internet appliances

	Computer networks is a little outdated given that now some non traditional devices are being hooked up to the internet

- IP picture frame
- Web-enabled toaster + weather forecaster
- Tweet-a-watt: monitor energy use
- Internet refrigerator
- Slingbox: watch, control cable TV remotely
- Internet phones

--
What's the Internet: a service view

	- Application Programming Interface (API): set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the internet can deliver its data to the destination program
	- Like the postal service API is put data which is letter in an envelop, seal, stamp, write address and drop at mailbox 

- Infrastructure that provides services to applications:
	- Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, social nets, …
- provides programming interface to apps
	- hooks that allow sending and receiving  app programs to “connect” to Internet
	- provides service options, analogous to postal service
	
--
What's a protocol?

- human protocols:
	- "what's the time?"
	- "i have a question"
	- introductions

- network protocols:
	- machines rather than humans
	- all communication activity in Internet governed by protocols

... specific msgs sent
... specific actions taken when msgs received, or other events

- protocols define format, order of msgs sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt
- a human protocol and a computer network protocol:

####1.2 network edge (end systems, access networks, links)####

--
A closer look at network structure

- network edge:
	- hosts: clients and servers
	- servers often in data centres
- access networks, physical media
	- wired, wireless communication links
- network core
	- interconnected routers
	- network of networks

--
Access networks and physical media

	In home the 2 most popular broadband residential access is DSL (digital subscriber line) and cable

*Q: How to connect end systems to edge router?*

	- residential access nets
	- institutional access networks (school, company)
	- mobile access networks

- keep in mind:
	- bandwidth (bits per second) of access network?
	- shared or dedicated?

--
Access net: digital subscriber line (DSL)

	- Typically DSL is obtained from the same local telephone company. It uses twisted pair coper wire
	- DSLAM: Digital subscriber line access multiplexer
	- DSL provider might limit max rate due to tiered services, distance might limit, electrical interference,..
	- DSL is used for short distances if the residential access is not within 10miles from the CO alternative methods must be seeked

- use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM
	- data over DSL phone line goes to Internet
	- voice over DSL phone line goes to telephone net
- < 2.5 Mbps upstream transmission rate (typically < 1 Mbps)
- < 24 Mbps downstream transmission rate (typically < 10 Mbps)

--
Access net: cable network

	- Cable modem termination system (CMTS): turns analog signal to digital
	- One junction serves 500 to 5000 homes
	- Cable makes use of the existing television’s company cable.

frequency division multiplexing: different channels transmitted
in different frequency bands

- HFC: hybrid fiber coax
	- asymmetric: up to 42.8Mbps downstream transmission rate, 30.7 Mbps upstream transmission rate
- network of cable, fiber attaches homes to ISP router
	- homes share access network to cable headend 
	- unlike DSL, which has dedicated access to central office

--
Access net: home network

--
Access net: fiber to the home

	ONT: Optical network terminator
	OLT: Optical Line terminator
	Splitter combines up to 100 homes

- Optical Distribution Network Architecture
	- Active (AON)
	- Passive (PON)
- Rates can be up to gigabit per second

--
Enterprise access networks (Ethernet)

- typically used in companies, universities, etc
- 10 Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps transmission rates
- today, end systems typically connect into Ethernet switch

--
Wireless access networks

- shared wireless access network connects end system to router
	- via base station aka “access point”
- wireless LANs:
	- within building (100 ft)
	- 802.11b/g/n/ac (WiFi): up to 300Mbps transmission rate
- wide-area wireless access
	- provided by telco (cellular) operator, 10’s km
	- between 1 and 40 Mbps 
	- 3G, 4G:  LTE

--
Host: sends packets of data

host sending function:

- takes application message
- breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length L bits
- transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R
	- link transmission rate, aka link capacity, aka link bandwidth

--
Physical media

	Bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium

- bit: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- physical link: what lies between transmitter & receiver
- guided media: 
	- signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
- unguided media: 
	- signals propagate freely, e.g., radio, satellite
- twisted pair (TP)
	- two insulated copper wires
		- Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gpbs Ethernet
		- Category 6: 10Gbps

--
Physical media: coax, fiber

- coaxial cable:
	- two concentric copper conductors
	- bidirectional
	- broadband:
 		- multiple channels on cable
- fiber optic cable:
	- glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
	- Used mostly in overseas links
	- high-speed operation:
		- high-speed point-to-point transmission (e.g., 10’s-100’s Gpbs transmission rate)
	- low error rate: 
		- repeaters spaced far apart 
		- immune to electromagnetic noise

--
Physical media: radio

- signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
- no physical “wire”
- bidirectional
- propagation environment effects:
	- reflection 
	- obstruction by objects
	- interference

radio link types:

- terrestrial  microwave
	- e.g. up to 45 Mbps channels
- LAN (e.g., WiFi)
	- 11Mbps, 300 Mbps
- wide-area (e.g., cellular)
	- 3G cellular: ~ few Mbps
- satellite
	- Kbps to hundreds Mbps channel (or multiple smaller channels)
	- 270 msec end-end delay
	- geosynchronous versus low altitude


####1.3 network core (packet switching, circuit switching, network structure)####

--
The network core

- mesh of interconnected routers
- packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into packets
	- forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination
	- each packet transmitted at full link capacity

--
Packet-switching: store-and-forward

- takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bps
- store and forward: entire packet must  arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
- end-end delay = 2L/R (assuming zero propagation delay) -> more on delay shortly ...
- one-hop numerical example:
	- L = 7.5 Mbits
	- R = 1.5 Mbps
	- one-hop transmission delay = 5 sec

--
Packet Switching: queueing delay, loss

queuing and loss: 

- If arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time:
	- packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link 
	- packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up

--
Two key network-core functions

- routing: determines source-destination route taken by packets
	- routing algorithms
- forwarding: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output

--
##May 9 Lecture 3##
Review:

circuit switching is faster than package switching?  - False since it depends how many cars

--
Alternative core: circuit switching

- In the previous lecture we discussed a one approach to moving data inside the networks which is packet switching
	- Packets use the resources on demand
	- Packets may have to wait to access a link
- Now we will introduce another core: circuit switching
	- Resources are reserved for the communication duration
	- Guaranteed constant rate
- end-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source & dest:
	- In diagram, each link has four circuits. 
		- call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st circuit in right link.
	- dedicated resources: no sharing
		- circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
	- circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)
	- Commonly used in traditional telephone networks

--
Circuit switching: FDM versus TDM

	Two simple multiple access control techniques.
	- Each mobile’s share of the bandwidth is divided into portions for the uplink and the downlink. Also, possibly, out of band signaling.
	- As we will see, used in AMPS, GSM, IS-54/136

--
Circuit switching: Transmission time

Question:

- How long will it take to send a 640Kb file from Host A to Host B 
	- Transmission rate for each circuit= 1.536Mbps/24 = 64kbps
- All links use TDM with 24 slots and have1.536Mbps bit rate
	- Transmission time = 640(kb)/64 (kbps)= 10 + 0.5 = 10.5 seconds
- Delay to establish a link is 500ms
	- Note that the time is constant independent of number of links

--
Packet switching versus circuit switching

packet switching allows more users to use network!

- example: 1 Mb/s link. Each user: 100 kb/s when “active”, active 10% of time

- circuit-switching:  10 users
- packet switching: with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time is less than .0004 *
- Q: how did we get value 0.0004?
- Q: what happens if > 35 users ?
- Solution: Using the binomial distribution: the probability of getting exactly  k success in n trials is given by the probability mass function:
*add function here*

- is packet switching a "slam dunk winner?"
	- great for bursty data
		- resource sharing
		- simpler, no call setup
	- excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss
		- protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
	- Q: How to provide circuit-like behavior?
		- bandwidth guarantees needed for audio/video apps
		- still an unsolved problem (chapter 7)
- Q:  human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching) versus on-demand allocation (packet-switching)?

--
Internet structure: network of networks

- End systems connect to Internet via access ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
	- Residential, company and university ISPs
- Access ISPs in turn must be interconnected. 
	- So that any two hosts can send packets to each other
- Resulting network of networks is very complex
	- Evolution was driven by economics and national policies
- Let’s take a stepwise approach to describe current Internet structure
- *Question: given millions of access ISPs, how to connect them together?*
	- Option: connect each access ISP to every there access ISP?
		- connecting each access ISP to each other directly doesn't scale: O(N2) connections.
	
	- Option: connect each access ISP to a global transit ISP? Customer and provider ISPs have economic agreement.
		- but if one global ISP is viable business, there will be competitors...
			- which must be interconnected
			- and regional networks may arise to connect access nets to ISPS
			- and content provider networks (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Akamai) may run their own network, to bring services, content close to end users
- at center: small # of well-connected large networks
	- “tier-1” commercial ISPs (e.g., Level 3, Sprint, AT&T, NTT), national & international coverage
	- content provider network (e.g, Google): private network that connects it data centers to Internet, often bypassing tier-1, regional ISPs


####1.4 delay, loss, throughput in networks####

--
How do loss and delay occur?

- packets queue in router buffers 
	- packet arrival rate to link (temporarily) exceeds output link capacity
	- packets queue, wait for turn

--
Four sources of packet delay

- check bit errors
- determine output link
- typically < msec


- time waiting at output link for transmission
- depends on congestion level of router

Securing TCP

- TCP & UDP
	- no encryption
	- cleartext passwds sent into socket traverse Internet  in cleartext
- Secure sockets layer (SSL)
	- provides encrypted TCP connection
	- data integrity
	- end-point authentication
- SSL is at app layer
	- Apps use SSL libraries, which “talk” to TCP
- SSL socket API
	- cleartext passwds sent into socket traverse Internet  encrypted
	- See Chapter 7

--
SSL

1. Browser connects to a web server (website) secured with SSL (https). Browser requests that the server identify itself.
2. Server sends a copy of its SSL Certificate, including the server’s public key.
3. Browser checks the certificate root against a list of trusted CAs and that the certificate is unexpired, unrevoked, and that its common name is valid for the website that it is connecting to. If the browser trusts the certificate, it creates, encrypts, and sends back a symmetric session key using the server’s public key.
4. Server decrypts the symmetric session key using its private key and sends back an acknowledgement encrypted with the session key to start the encrypted session.
5. Server and Browser now encrypt all transmitted data with the session key.

##Lecture 4##
####*2.2 Web and HTTP*####

--
What is the Web?

- The Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the Internet. Information that travels over the Internet does so via a variety of languages known as protocols.
- The World Wide Web, or simply Web, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the Internet. The Web uses the HTTP protocol, only one of the languages spoken over the Internet, to transmit data. Web services, which use HTTP to allow applications to communicate in order to exchange business logic, use the the Web to share information. The Web also utilizesbrowsers, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox, to access Web documents called Web pages that are linked to each other via hyperlinks. Web documents also contain graphics, sounds, text and video.

--
Web and HTTP

- First, a review…
	- web page consists of objects
	- object can be HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file,…
	- web page consists of base HTML-file which includes several referenced objects
	- each object is addressable by a URL, e.g.,
		- www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif

--
HTTP overview

- HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
	- Web’s application layer protocol
	- client/server model
		- client: browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and “displays” Web objects 
		- server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
- uses TCP:
	- client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server,  port 80
	- server accepts TCP connection from client
	- HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
	- TCP connection closed
- HTTP is “stateless”
	- server maintains no information about past client requests
- protocols that maintain “state” are complex!
	- past history (state) must be maintained
	- if server/client crashes, their views of “state” may be inconsistent, must be reconciled

--
HTTP connections

- non-persistent HTTP
	- at most one object sent over TCP connection
		- connection then closed
	- downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
- persistent HTTP
	- multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, server

--
Non-persistent HTTP

suppose user enters URL:
www.someSchool.edu/someDepartment/home.index

(contains text, references to 10 jpeg images)

1a. HTTP client initiates TCP connection to HTTP server (process) at www.someSchool.edu on port 80

1b. HTTP server at host www.someSchool.edu waiting for TCP connection at port 80.  “accepts” connection, notifying client

2.HTTP client sends HTTP request message (containing URL) into TCP connection socket. Message indicates that client wants object someDepartment/home.index

3.HTTP server receives request message, forms response message containing requested object, and sends message into its socket

4.HTTP server closes TCP connection. 

5.HTTP client receives response message containing html file, displays html.  Parsing html file, finds 10 referenced jpeg  objects

6.Steps 1-5 repeated for each of 10 jpeg objects
